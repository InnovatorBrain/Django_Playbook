# Models

+ create models in specific assigned app 
+ also can create more classes in one models.py 
+ DEFINE "OneToOne", "OneToMany", "ManyToMany" RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM

### Circular Relationship:
it means the classes' dependency increases on each other. (or the upper class access error).
+ Django makes a reverse relationship for us as a default(in this case it produces error)
 1. Use relation class name in a string like 'Product'
 2. Set it tell Django not to create a reverse relationship
 - related_name = '+'

# Creating Relationships among model classes:
### Reminder : 
Django creates primary keys automatically if we do not specify. 
How?
- There is a parent and child class, we have to define the relationship in the child class.
Examples. In Product Class:

      collection = models.OneToOneField(Collection, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
      collection = models.ForeignKey(Collection, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
      promotions = models.ManyToManyField(Promotion, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
The examples are 1-1, 1-*, *-* respectively. on_delete behave if the parent class(Collection) is deleted what will happen with the child class?


### Generic Relationship* (ONE APP TO OTHER APP)
Use the ContentType app for generic relationships which is already installed in the settings

    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
