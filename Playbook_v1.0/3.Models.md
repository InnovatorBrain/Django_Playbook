# Models

+ create models in specific assigned app 
+ also can create more classes in one models.py 
+ DEFINE "OneToOne", "OneToMany", "ManyToMany" RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM

### Circular Relationship:
it means the classes dependency increase on each other. (or the uper class access error).
+ Django makes a reverse relationship for us as a default(in this case it produces error)
 1. Use relation class name in string like 'Product'
 2. Set it tells django not to create reverse relationship
 - related_name = '+'

### Generic Relationship* (ONE APP TO OTHER APP)
use ContentType app for generic relationships which is already installed in settings
