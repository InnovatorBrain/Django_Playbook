# Models

+ create models in specific assigned app 
+ also can create more classes in one models.py 
+ DEFINE "OneToOne", "OneToMany", "ManyToMany" RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM

### Circular Relationship:
it means the classes' dependency increases on each other. (or the upper-class access error).
+ Django makes a reverse relationship for us as a default(in this case it produces error)
 1. Use relation class name in a string like 'Product'
 2. Set it to tell Django not to create a reverse relationship
 - related_name = '+'

# Creating Relationships among model classes:
### Reminder : 
Django creates primary keys automatically if we do not specify. 
How?
- There is a parent and child class, we have to define the relationship in the child class.
Examples. In Product Class:

      collection = models.OneToOneField(Collection, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
      collection = models.ForeignKey(Collection, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
      promotions = models.ManyToManyField(Promotion, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
The examples are 1-1, 1-*, *-* respectively. on_delete behave if the parent class(Collection) is deleted what will happen with the child class?

- If the Parent Model class in a relationship is defined after the child or in a circular dependency case, the class that is defined in the latter shows an error.
How?
1. Parent class in underscore
2. (related_name='+') for not to create a reverse relationship. Because Django does not support perfectly reverse relationship

       featured_product = models.ForeignKey('Product', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, related_name='+')


### Generic Relationship* (ONE APP TO OTHER APP)
Use the ContentType app for generic relationships which is already installed in the settings

    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
 #### Explore these things
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
.

    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
.

    from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericForeignKey

### Example Same in the Generic Relationship (means another app to identify itself).
    from django.db import models                # Importing the 'models' module from Django's database framework
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User  # Importing the 'User' model from Django's authentication framework
    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType  # Importing the 'ContentType' model for tracking models
    from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericForeignKey  # Importing the 'GenericForeignKey' field for generic relationships

    class LikedItem(models.Model):               # Defining a class named 'LikedItem' that inherits from 'models.Model'
        user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Creating a foreign key field 'user' linked to 'User' model
        content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Creating a foreign key field 'content_type' linked to 
        'ContentType' model
        object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()  # Creating a field to store positive integers 'object_id'
        content_object = GenericForeignKey()      # Creating a generic foreign key field 'content_object'
